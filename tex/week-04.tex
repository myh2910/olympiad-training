\begin{probMR}[Balkan MO 2005/4]
	Let $n\ge 2$ be an integer. Let $S$ be a subset of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ such that $S$ neither contains two elements one of which divides the other, nor contains two elements which are coprime. What is the maximal possible number of elements of such a set $S$?

\end{probMR}

\begin{proof}
	La respuesta es $\floor{\frac{n+2}{4}}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{probMB}[Croatian MO 2018/5]
	Let $n$ be a positive integer. $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n$ are points inside a circle and $B_1,B_2,\dots,B_n$ points on that circle such that the segments $A_iB_i$ are pairwise disjoint for $1\le i\le n$. A grasshopper can move from point $A_i$ to $A_j$ where $i\ne j$ if and only if segment $A_iA_j$ doesn't pass through any of segments $A_kB_k$ for $1\le k\le n$.

	Prove that the grasshopper can move from any point $A_i$ to $A_j$ in a finite sequence of moves.
