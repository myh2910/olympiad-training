\begin{abstract}
	This is a collection of the problems that we discussed during the class. Some problems that were not discussed during the class are under the subsection ``Practice Problems''. All proofs are written in spanish. The letters \verb|E|, \verb|M|, \verb|H| and \verb|Z| indicate the hardness of a problem at an increasing level. The \customgreen{green}, \customblue{blue} and \customred{red} colors indicate that the problem was solved during the class, the problem was solved after the class or using a hint, and the problem was solved by the teacher.
