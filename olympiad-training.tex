\begin{abstract}
	This is a collection of math olympiad problems and solutions. Most of them were discussed from \href{https://www.facebook.com/emerson.sorianoperez}{Emerson Soriano}'s class. The letters \verb|E|, \verb|M|, \verb|H| and \verb|Z| indicate the hardness of a problem at an increasing level. The \customgreen{green}, \customblue{blue} and \customred{red} colors indicate that the problem was solved by myself, by using a hint, and by someone else (or not solved).
